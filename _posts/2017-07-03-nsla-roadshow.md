title: NSLA Roadshow
---

The [National and State Libraries of Australasia](http://www.nsla.org.au/) are funding an eight-city roadshow to bring Library 
Carpentry to their institutions in 2017. These are targeted workshops for staff of those institutions only.

The roadshow kicks off in Hobart in mid-July, and ends in Perth at the end of August. The NZ leg, at the National Library of New Zealand
in Wellington, is still being finalised, as there is strong interest from university libraries to extend the roadshow to their staffs.

Current workshop dates and places are posted on the [Library Carpentry](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/) website.

Belinda Weaver will be teaching the one-day workshops, with the assistance of the State Library of Victoria's Aimee Said, 
and other local helpers.

The format will be hands-on, one-day workshops that introduce jargon busting, data structures, the use of regular expressions for pattern matching, automation of tasks using the Unix shell, and the use of OpenRefine to transform and clean up data.
