This blog will advertise [Software Carpentry](http://www.software-carpentry.org/), [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) and [Library Carpentry](http://github.com/LibraryCarpentry) events in Australia. It will also include news about events such as the annual [Research Bazaar](https://twitter.com/ResBaz) also known as **ResBaz**.

### More Information

The contributors are Belinda Weaver and Damien Irving. We can help you organise [Software Carpentry](http://www.software-carpentry.org/), [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) and [Library Carpentry](http://github.com/LibraryCarpentry) events in Australia once you have requested a workshop through the proper channels. 

If you want a Software Carpentry workshop at your institution, [request one here](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request/). Ask here if you want a [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops-host/) workshop.

Belinda is an organiser for Brisbane [ResBaz](https://twitter.com/ResBaz). I help run a weekly [hacky hour at UQ](https://twitter.com/HackyHourStLuc) where the hacky hour team try to answer your research IT questions.
